# DOM Assignment #2

_Start with a new repo!!!_ 
(Yes, that means write the files from scratch)

Start with the following HTML:

```
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <div id="container"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In your `index.js` file, create the following elements:

* `<h1></h1>`
* `<h2></h2>`
* 3 `<p></p>`
* 1 `<ul></ul>`
* 3 `<li></li>` as _children_ of the previous `<ul>`

Put any text you would like in all the elements. If you're not sure what to put, try using your folktale.
